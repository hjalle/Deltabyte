# Deltabyte - trivial implementation of delta generation of byte arrays on dotnet core

See https://cdsrc.com/posts/delta-generation-dotnet-core/ for more information.

Should not be used as this was only a test. Two different approaches were tested, one diffing byte by byte and another one with unsafe pointer arithmetics.
